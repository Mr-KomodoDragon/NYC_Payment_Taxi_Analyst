#Payment System Analysis of NYC Yellow Taxis

##Business Problem Understanding

**Context**:<br>

There are two Payment System Service Providers for Yellow Cabs in New York City (NYC), namely Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC and VeriFone Inc. (as a third party for Yellow Cabs). They want to increase their revenue by optimizing their business operations. These companies have access to trip record data conducted by taxi drivers, recorded by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The data includes information about pickup locations, trip duration, fares, payment methods, and more during the month of January 2023. The companies want to use this data to identify **factors** that can influence the payment system they provide.

**Note: My role is as a freelancer.**<br>

Both Payment System Service Providers want to increase their revenue through their payment systems. They want to understand the factors that can encourage customers to pay for taxis using their provided payment system, specifically focusing on credit card payments. They aim to utilize the trip record data conducted by taxi drivers.

**Goal**: <br>

Based on the problem mentioned, the companies want to identify the factors that can contribute to increasing their revenue, specifically focusing on credit card payments for taxis.

**Analytic Approach**: <br>

My approach will involve analyzing the trip record data to discover the factors that can influence revenue growth for the two Payment System Service Providers based on their available records.

**Conclusion & Recommendation**
From my analysis, I can conclude that the revenue earned by VeriFone Inc. & Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC is dependent on the taxi companies. This is because the fare or additional charges are determined by the Taxi Company and the driver themselves. However, I have found a solution to address the problem faced by both vendors in terms of increasing passengers' willingness to pay their taxi fees using the provided Credit Card Payment System.

Here are the recommended actions for VeriFone Inc. & Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC:

- Provide discounts for popular trips, such as the Standard rate or within New York City, ranging from 5-10% for all types of Credit Cards in the United States, such as MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Citi, and Discover.
- Offer cashback rewards or exchange coupons with reward points for Credit Card payments.
- Develop other payment options such as E-Payment applications, so that people do not need to present their credit cards. They can simply top up their E-Payment balance and have it automatically debited upon trip completion.
- Provide Debit Card payment options as well, not just limited to Credit Cards. This allows people without credit cards to still pay for taxis using the EDC machines provided by VeriFone Inc. & Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC.
- Ensure that the credit card payment service is available for taxis driven by drivers with good criteria and reviews, as I observed some trip records with disputes. These disputes arise when passengers refuse to pay or pay an incorrect fare due to disagreements with the driver.
